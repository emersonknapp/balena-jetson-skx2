            - subject: Increase NTP polling time to around 4.5 hours.
              hash: 4a47b9297b37277a9aece0ea322e706dbe473f12

                This commit increases the default NTP poll rate to around 4.5
                hours.


                BalenaOS uses chronyd for time synchronization, and it allows to
                specify

                a minpoll and maxpoll values per server with a power of two
                number of

                seconds for the minimum and maximum polling time respectively.


                With those constraints, the change set both limits to 2^14s
                (4.55h) for

                all servers.


                An architectural decision has been made not to make this
                configurable.


                Fixes #1780.

                It is better to use fdisk to check that an internal media
                is a suitable block device rather than using the shell
                internal block testing feature. This is because there is
                at least a case when the kernel lists an ASMT 2115 controller
                as /dev/sda but that is not an actual drive so it cannot be
                written to and the flashing procedure will error out.

                We inherit do_populate_lic_deploy from poky. It uses IMAGE_NAME

                which includes DATETIME


                DATETIME changes between runs so we can sometimes get into a
                state

                where the do_populate_lic_deploy task has its stamp file set.


                But when our subsequent deploy_image_license_manifest task runs,
                the

                DATETIME is different. Hence we get into a state where we have
                to

                run cleanall on the resin-image-flasher recipe to clean up
                directories.


                Lets mark do_populate_lic_deploy with nostamp. This should make
                it

                run every time we need to run deploy_image_license_manifest with
                the

                most up to date DATETIME variable to prevent any hiccups

                resulting

                it in remaining stuck in an endless loop.

                subsequent

                engine healthcheck will fail retriggering the healthcheck load.

      body: |
        Issuing lsusb will trigger loading of the tegra
        xusb firmware, and the first call will fail. This because
        when the driver was loaded it failed to load it from the
        initramfs as it wasn't present, and after a couple
        retries the process was aborted.

        Install firmware in initramfs so that it can
        be loaded when the driver loads and avoid
        usb related issues.

        After the latest updates, some services
        and scripts seem to no longer be necessary.

        Removing them so brcm_patcram_plus is no
        longer taking up CPU, hci0 timeouts warnings
        are no longer present. hcitool scan works.

        Tested with devkit, spacely and orrbity
        carrier boards.

                Customers usually don't need this delay during u-boot. Also in
                some

                cases, hardware attached on the uart pins might pause uboot
                preventing

                customers from using dev images easily.


                But we do need this delay during our development work on bsps
                etc.


                Lets make this autoboot delay build time configurable


                Also make the BOOTDELAY -2 which is better than 0 as that
                completely

                prevents any char on serial from interrupting boot.

                Otherwise, systemd will have its own cgroup manager and cgroupfs
                will

                be another cgroup manager via balenaEngine daemon.

                PR #1441 changed mnt-sysroot-inactive to an automount. But there
                is no

                way to easily add a udev dependency to the automount. As a
                result,

                when rollbacks tries to access the inactive partition, it fails.

                Let's add systemd-udev-settle.service to the rollback services.


                This will only delay the first boot after a HUP which is
                reasonable.

                bootloader

                as bad reboots.


                To prevent this from happening, add a service that clears the
                bootcount

                upon good reboots. This only runs if the rollback services have
                not

                cleared their flag files in the state partition.

                U-boot has its own bootcount framework. However, that will
                require

                handling in each device type. We will use u-boot shell commands

                env import -t, env export -t, fatload, fatwrite

                to read/write/increment bootcount in env_resin.h.


                This will allow us to scale to lots of devices.


                A flag os_bootcount_skip is left for devices that are unable to
                support

                fatwrite in u-boot (in some rare cases). This will allow a

                We'd like to enable some options in all boards header files via

                meta-balena. This patch adds a task to include config_resin.h
                into

                config_default.h (which is included in all board header files).

                We can then add a config option via meta-balena that will be
                enabled for

                all devices.


                This patch enables CONFIG_RESET_TO_RETRY. If for whatever
                strange reason

                (accidental fs issue in u-boot etc), this will trigger a u-boot
                reset

                command the device in 15 seconds.


                Note This requires that the device's u-boot supports the reset
                command

                which it probably should.

                unable to start a new container. This is usually when something
                in runc

                or containerd is not functioning correctly.


                Add a healthcheck to spin up a simple hello-world container as
                well.


                The trade-off here is that there will be a few extra writes to
                disk

                every healthcheck timeout. But there will be a benefit that if
                runc

                or containerd is in a bad state, the healthcheck will fail and
                systemd

                will restart the balena daemon to recover the application
                container

                zeros. But lets reduce the size of the data partition to eat
                less

                space whenever an uncompressed image is used anywhere. e.g. when

                extracting the zip to dd or using balena-migrate etc.


                The partition expands on first boot to fill the rest of the disk

                anyways.

      hash: 298c68fac353f073977c17adc4a7ee4bf2b1e233
      body: >
        Netflix has identified several TCP networking vulnerabilities

        in FreeBSD and Linux kernels. The vulnerabilities specifically

        relate to the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) and TCP

        Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) capabilities.

        The most serious, dubbed SACK Panic, allows a

        remotely-triggered kernel panic on recent Linux kernels.


        These patches address most of these vulnerabilities.

        These files are brought in from the Ubuntu demo image
        provided by NVidia but are modified for our usecases.

        We don't execute the bluetooth scripts from the udev
        rule, instead we invoke them from the nvbtwifi* service
        files. Also it is important to bring device up before
        BlueZ gets the chance to interfere with it to avoid
        intermittent failures.

                Fixes #1564


                This bbclass uses the common layer path advertised by BBLAYERS
                to find

                the paths to different resources in board repository. For
                example

                machine json - to get the slug and advertise it in os-release.
                After

                renaming the common layer (resin to balena) and because we
                support old

                references to the old common layer name (by including a dummy

                deprecation layer), we need to make sure this class can cope now
                with

                both cases.

                    VERSION_ID="2.37.0-rev1"

                This patch reverts that to make sure rev is a build tag.

                This change backports a PR[1] that is already in systemd and

                included by default from the version in Yocto warrior.


                In summary, with this change we fix newer NM which stopped
                handling

                rp_filter when connected to multiple interfaces. See "device:
                disable

                rp_filter handling" commit from NM. Without this change, only
                the

                default route will me usable and binding to a specific interface
                will

                break connectivity if that interface is not also the default
                route for

                the target IP.

                Currently, bluez's storage data is set to /var/lib/bluetooth
                which

                in turn is a tmpfs location. We want this location persistent so
                we can

                save paired devices over reboot. We do that by adding the
                corresponding

                bind mount to the state partition and setting bluez to depend on
                this

                mount unit.

                VERSION and VERSION_ID had a slightly different semantics in
                balenaOS.

                VERSION was referring to the BalenaOS (host OS) version (which
                is coming from

                device repositories) while VERSION_ID was set to the
                DISTRO_VERSION.

                This brings confusion so we change it to adhere to

                https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html.

                Since 1.29, busybox switched to an internal implementation of
                the

                resolver based on a feature config, NSLOOKUP_BIG. This is
                enabled by

                default and it's meant to be musl compatible. In BalenaOS we use
                glibc

                and we rely on it for being able to resolve names using NSS
                modules

                (libmdns).

                kept

                firmwares. For example:

                 Cleaning iwlwifi firmware version 8000C to minimum API version 34.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-13.ucode.

                   Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-36.ucode in place.

                Also, this commit improves the version comparison which was
                comparing

                strings and not integers. Now we try integer comparison and
                fallback to

                string when parse fails.


                Finally, the task's vardeps expands varflags to correctly
                retrigger on

                change.

                This adds set_os_cmdline which defines os_cmdline so that BSPs
                can

                import it in their bootargs and pass it to kernel accordingly.
                Also, as

                part of os_cmdline, there is an argument added when the booted
                image is

                a flasher. This can be used in the OS for various flasher
                specific

                checks.

                Since yocto thud, and more specifically since poky switched to

                openssl 1.1 line, the openssl binary is provided by
                'openssl-bin'. On

                that version, 'openssl' doesn't provide this binary making the
                uuid

                generation script fail.


                This patch makes 'openssl-bin' the default dependency but does
                that in a

                way that older yocto versions can overwrite it back to the old
                provider

                (openssl package).

        Customers compiling out of tree kernel modules related to video camera
        will require headers from drivers/media/platform/tegra/camera.
        Also, customers building out of tree modules might also make use of
        dma-iommu.h and hypervisor.h and on the Jetson TX2 kernel
        (which is 64 bits) these header files actually include their 32 bits
        counterparts so let's add those too.

              body: >
                When we set the udev rule we use IMPORT{program} to know what
                symlinks

                to create in the sysroot directory. The problem is that we don't
                use

                absolute paths and from the documentation udev uses
                /usr/lib/udev as the

                default path while we install the invoked script in /lib/udev.


                ```
                  Execute an external program specified as the assigned value. If no
                  absolute path is given, the program is expected to live in
                  /usr/lib/udev; otherwise, the absolute path must be specified.
                ```


                This PR changes the udev rule to use an absolute path for the

                resin_update_state_probe script. Also it fixes some typos in the
                script

                itself.

              body: >
                Since thud, poky distro file on which balena OS is based,
                already

                includes security_flags.inc. Because of this change, this
                version throws

                a build warning similar to:


                WARNING Duplicate inclusion for
                /build/../layers/poky/meta/conf/distro/include/security_flags.inc

                in
                /build/../layers/meta-resin/meta-balena-thud/conf/distro/include/balena-os-yocto-version.inc


                This happens because again, we import `poky` and
                `security_flags` but

                since thud, poky includes security_flags by default. In order to
                avoid

                this warning we import it (security_flags) now using an .inc
                file at the

                level of the yocto version meta-balena layer. There is as well a
                small

                additional wrinkle here. We switch the include statement from
                `require`

                to `include` so new layers (like thud) don't have to carry this
                hack in

                the future.


                This commit prepares meta-balena for thud support.

                supported

                devtool moves the files from the WORKDIR into
                ${S}/oe-local-files which makes

                copying of env_resin.h fail if the u-boot source is being
                modified using

                devtool. Since devtool also alters FILESPATH to include said
                oe-local-files

                directory, we can iterate over those paths instead of relying on
                WORKDIR.

                balenaOS comes in two flavours, production/development.
                production

                images have various options passed to the kernel cmdline.

                Currently some devices BSPs have those options passed and some
                dont.

                It'll be hard to keep the common options consistent.

                e.g. consoleblank=0 is passed for some devices and not for
                others.


                We'd like the extra options we pass to be in one place. All BSPs
                can

                then append this variable in their respective recipe/bootloader
                config

                etc.

                It is best to not create anything in ${B} even if just temporary
                because

                it alters the directory in ways which can break other parts of
                the build

                system. For example, if there is a leftover kernel_source.tar.gz
                in B,

                then the current kernel-devsrc will create a hardlink of this
                file in

                the kernel source tree and then the command:

                tar -czf ${B}/kernel_source.tar.gz -C "$kerneldir/../" .


                will fail like:

                By default, chrony will slowly and gracefully take measurements
                from

                the new ntp server. The burst 4/10 command will make chrony take
                4 good

                measurements within 2 seconds each. It will try up to 10 times.

                Fixes #1385

                The partition numbers are hex and not integers. This is obvious
                when

                using the jetson family of devices as their partition numbering
                starts

                at 0xc.


                - Change integer comparisons to string comparisons.

                - Convert current_part_idx to hex for a valid string comparison

                From u-boot docs:

                "Almost all U-Boot commands expect numbers to be entered in
                hexadecimal

                input format"


                We only hit this in the jetson family as the boot partition
                there is

                0xc. Add a simple conversion to hex. This should not affect any
                devices

                that use <9 partition numbers. And allow us to use the same hook

                from meta-balena accross all devices. Currently the jetson
                family has

                its own custom hook with this one-liner.

                We have noticed devices in support that show high cpu usage
                because

                the process chronyc online seems to be eating up 50% cpu.


                This is probably fixed upstream

            - subject: Fix img to rootfs dependency when img is invalidated
              hash: 3050840935541c14ded2f9a6a1517d73dfc5ec18
              body: >
                There can be cases where a image type gets invalidated (due to a

                variable change or so) and the dependency of it not. For example
                the img

                type can get invalidated while the hostapp ext3 type doesn't.
                The img

                generatiton script consumes/uses the rootfs generated by the
                hostapp

                type but, it references the artifact based on IMAGE_NAME
                variable which

                includes a time stamp. See bitbake.conf:


                IMAGE_NAME = "${IMAGE_BASENAME}-${MACHINE}-${DATETIME}"


                When that happens, the new timestamp will change and img will
                fail to

                find the old artifact of hostapp. Change this behaviour by using
                the

                symlink reference IMAGE_LINK_NAME which doesn't include a
                timestamp.

                Under the current configuration we instruct NetworkManager
                through its

                configuration to completely ignore all the tun devices. This was

                enforced as an extra precation as we run an openvpn client which

                connects to the balena-cloud backend. This client creates, on
                the host,

                the interface `resin-tun` currently (rename pending). We want to
                loosen

                up this restriction to only unmanage this specific device -
                `resin-tun`

                - so that users can take advantage of NetworkManager managing
                other tun

                devices.

                For some reason, using xargs -I a produced spurious difficult to

                errors. Rework test case using a loop. Do the arch check using
                Yoctos

                QA framework that runs on all packages. Otherwise, we'd have to
                manually

                map various compatible arches e.g. aarch64 - arm8, 80386 - x86


                bberror does not exit the do_compile task. Add exit 1 to make
                sure that

                if an error is found, the task is marked as failed. Otherwise
                the

                error becomes a heisenbug as bitbake proceeds after do_compile.

                63baa421 introduced a bug where the tools in the header tarballs
                were

                compiled with the incorrect HOSTCC parameter. As a result the
                tools

                inside the tarball were compiled for x86-64 instead of the
                native

                device architecture. And they had the incorrect ld interpreter
                path

                as well.


                Update to v0.0.12 to fix that.

                This release also adds objtool support needed by the intel nuc
                image.

                For now only allow `wifi.scan-rand-mac-address` configurable
                from

                config.json using `randomMacAddressScan` as the json key.


                config.json snippet example:


                "os": {
                  "network" : {
                    "wifi": {
                      "randomMacAddressScan": false
                    }
                  }
                }


                We include a set of tests for this tool which are ran at build
                time.

                The bbappend uses a local `resin-files` directory for additional

                entries but some of these files ended up in `files`. This works
                well if

                the recipe used is the one in the same directory as the `files`

                subdirectory will be used by default. The problem shows when the
                recipe

                is not in the same directoy as bitbake will not be able to find
                needed

                bbappended files.

                The label is actually a udev symlink, but we're keeping

                this naming to be consistent across the file.


                The error seen is that the balena-host service wasn't

                able to start because of a mnt-sysroot-active.service
                dependency:

                resin-partition-mounter[440]: ERROR: Timeout while waiting

                for filesystem label to appear


                By increasing this timeout, the filesystem symlink should

                already exist, at the time the mnt-sysroot-active service is

                looking for this dependency.

      body: |
        The device tree for the n510-tx2 machine seems to be loaded
        by the first stage bootloader program(before u-boot) on the
        jetson-tx2 instead of the jetson-tx2 device tree.
        This patch installs the n510-tx2 device tree only when the machine
        is built.

                As part of resin rename to balena, we rename the distro file
                including

                the OS name which is part of the distro name. This ends up in
                the

                dashboard as part of the OS version.

                Pin down cargo deps (using Cargo.lock) to versions known working
                with rust 1.24.1 (for sumo)
              hash: ef3e76f2d343e8cd367214b4b5ce52b3b97be262

                With Sumo 19.0.1, when building cargo 0.25.0 we get:

                | error[E0425]: cannot find function `read_to_string` in module
                `fs`

                |   -->
                /yocto/resin-board/build/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/cargo-native/

                0.25.0-r0/cargo_home/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/

                libssh2-sys-0.2.11/build.rs:99:26

                let config =
                fs::read_to_string("libssh2/src/libssh2_config_cmake.h.in")

                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ did you mean `read_string`?


                This is just one example of a package that fails like this.
                There are

                multiple packages in the cargo source tree that fail with this
                error.


                The cargo bbclass does a:

                cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release


                This has the following effect:

                NOTE:- cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release.

                Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`


                Updating the registry will result in using the versions pinned
                upstream.

                In our case, it will be using newer versions of packages that
                require a

                newer rust version (read_to_string was added in rust 1.26.0).
                But at the

                same time, the meta-rust layer which we use has an older rust
                version.

                (currently meta-rust on sumo branch has rust at version 1.24.1)


                The fix for such a case would be to use a Cargo.lock file which
                pins

                the packages to versions which are known to work with rust
                1.24.1,

                the version we use in sumo.
